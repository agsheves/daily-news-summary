## Purpose

To set up a way to automatically get risk, crisis, and disaster news stories and automatically format and share these online and by email.

## Elements

- API calls to several different news APIs to get the raw data
- ChatGTP to summarize the stories.
- An Anvil app to display the stories
- Anvil's email service
- Integration with a webpage

## Notes

The biggest challenge has been the consistency of the data from the news APIs and having sufficient credits to test the app before deciding on a service. Some services also performed well for short periods before deteriorating.

## Next steps

- [] Settle on a 'good enough' API and clean up the code to use this.
- [] Finish the web app to display the stories
- [] Publish the webapp HTML and embed on a webpage as a test
- [] Link to the raw stories to another service to integrate with a newsletter. This could be auto-posting to WordPress to send news out via the ConvertKit RSS feed.

## Other uses

The same set up could be used to publish a newsletter on any topic and share it in different formats.
